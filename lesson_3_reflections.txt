Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    it might be useful that push work's automatically
    after every commit 
    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   if want to copy an existing project and tweak for your own purpose than use fork. forks copy an existing project from other repository on github to your repository on github. 1 to 1 copy

   with branches you create a copy of a parent branch, so that the parent branch keeps untouchable, 

   with clone you copy the branch from github or other gitcloud to your local workspace

   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    you can see conflict's of the work of different colllaborators
    you're also up-to-date
    you can see conflicts occurs with your changes



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    i' going to work via cloud and different local repos... but we'll have a lot of repos and thousands of changes ...it comes very quick to a confuse stucture...communication to each other work via e-mail or chat

    collaboration it's going to be a big confuse
